# Separately Modifying a Specific Player

</div>

# Overview

You may wish to modify the appearance of a specific player character separately from all other players.

For example if a friend has given you a set of presets that they usually apply to their character, you can set up KBF to only apply those presets to that specific character so that you can see their intended appearance.

This can be done by creating a _player override_ for that character and assigning a preset group to it.
