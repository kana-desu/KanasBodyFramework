# Disabling Presets for Your Own Player Only

</div>

# Overview

You may wish to disable Kana's Body Framework (KBF) presets for your own player character if you want to continue using the Female Body Sliders (FBS) mod, etc.

This can be done by creating a player override for your player character which is set to 'default'.
