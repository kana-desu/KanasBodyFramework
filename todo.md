# TODOs

- eating at barbequeue removes everything from list.. I think just force refetch of slots once after cutscene ends
- crafting armour removes player
- custom bone not used from imported FBS presets? Does just need porting to Head parts...
- similarly grab player when you go to guild card... im surprised not handled this way already???
- don't fully grey out tabs when part doesn't exist for armour, just the list of bones.
- hide hair pieces
- hide kinsect
- select preset auto width
- NPC Clerk Dreamspell not applying?
